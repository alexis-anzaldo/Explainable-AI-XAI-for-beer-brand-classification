# Explainable-AI-XAI-for-beer-brand-classification

### This project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture to classify beer brands. Additional layers were added to improve the VGG16 model's performance by fine-tuning the trained parameters using transfer learning.

### The GRAD-CAM technique is used to visualize the regions of the image that are most significant for the CNN's classification decision, enabling a better understanding of the model's focus and decision-making process.

### To prepare the data optimally for the CNN, standard machine learning libraries such as Keras, Sklearn, and Numpy are utilized for data preprocessing and augmentation.

### The CNN achieves an accuracy of 91.6%, demonstrating its ability to classify beer brands effectively.
